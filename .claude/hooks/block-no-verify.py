❌ BLOCKED: Using --no-verify bypasses pre-commit hooks!

Pre-commit hooks exist to catch issues before they reach CI. If hooks are failing:
1. Fix the failing tests/checks (don't bypass them)
2. If the hooks themselves are broken, fix the hooks
3. Only use --no-verify as an absolute last resort

Bypassing hooks caused the CI failures we just debugged. Let's not repeat that mistake!
